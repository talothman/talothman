### Hi there :v:
I'm Talal. I'm a software engineer building Spatial Computing (aka. XR, aka. AR/MR/VR :smirk:) tools and learning experiences. I've worked in this space for the past 6 years in both industry and academic settings. Currently helping faculty at the University of Michigan integrate Spatial Computing into their classrooms. :raised_hands:
